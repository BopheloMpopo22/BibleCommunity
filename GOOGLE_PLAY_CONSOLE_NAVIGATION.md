**After creating your app, you should see:**

1. **On the LEFT side of the screen**, there's a **vertical menu** (sidebar)
2. This menu has different sections like:
   - 🏠 **Dashboard** (or "Overview")
   - 📱 **Store presence** (or "Store listing")
   - 📊 **Policy**
   - 🔧 **Setup**
   - 📦 **Release**
   - And more...

### Step 2: Find "Store presence" or "Store listing"

**Look for one of these in the LEFT sidebar:**

- **"Store presence"** ← Click this!
- **"Store listing"** ← Or this!
- **"Main store listing"** ← Or this!

**It's usually near the top of the left menu, below "Dashboard"**

## 🔍 If You Don't See the Left Sidebar

### Option A: The Sidebar is Collapsed
