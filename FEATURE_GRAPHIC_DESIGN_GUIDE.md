# 🎨 Feature Graphic Design Guide for Google Play

## What is a Feature Graphic?

## 🎯 What to Focus On When Designing

### 1. **App Name & Tagline** (Most Important!)
- **App Name:** "Bible Community" (large, bold, readable)
- **Tagline:** "Connect, Pray, and Grow Together" (smaller, below name)

### 2. **Visual Appeal**
- **Colors:** Use your app's brand colors (blues, whites, maybe gold/yellow accents)
- **Background:** Clean, not too busy (gradient or solid color works well)
- **Typography:** Bold, readable fonts (avoid fancy script fonts)

### 3. **Key Benefits** (Optional but Recommended)
- Show 2-3 key features:
  - "Daily Prayers"
  - "Bible Study"
  - "Community Support"
- Use icons or small text

### 4. **App Icon** (Optional)
- Include a small version of your app icon
- Helps with brand recognition
